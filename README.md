Finally completed this took me a while to do was truely challenging because I had to properly steal other people's code to add to my code but still had to understand what i was doing i found this blog post on medium that was talking shit against using dom and to use some scary lines of codes so I did what he said to do and used it instead of dom for getting the values without using getelementbyid which was cool cause I did alot of typos I had to use gemni to help me find typos that I did.
